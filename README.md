# Pishdad

**Pishdad is not a leadership project.**  
No one is being endorsed. No one is being rejected.  
We are not building a leader.

This repository is a collaborative space to explore and design a clear, humane, and practical framework for a peaceful transition toward a free Iran.

If the framework proves coherent, lawful, and capable of earning broad public trust, it may serve as a foundation for civic action.  
If it does not, it remains what it is meant to be: a collective exercise in thinking — an open attempt to refine better ideas.

Pishdad is an open draft.  
It exists to be examined, challenged, improved — or discarded.
