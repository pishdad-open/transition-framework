# Transition Model

## 1. Purpose of the Transition

A political transition is not an act of revenge.  
It is a process of stabilization.

The purpose of this transition model is to prevent cycles of violence, avoid institutional collapse, and ensure that power is transferred through lawful and transparent mechanisms toward a democratically elected constitutional order.

Moments of regime delegitimization are historically fragile.  
If unmanaged, they can lead to:

- Revenge-based violence
- Arbitrary purges
- Power vacuums
- Emergence of a new authoritarian structure

The central objective of this framework is therefore restraint.

Justice must replace anger.  
Procedure must replace impulse.  
Institutions must replace personalities.

This transition model proposes a temporary, civilian-based structure designed to:

- Safeguard public order without repression
- Ensure due process in accountability proceedings
- Prevent mob retaliation or extrajudicial punishment
- Maintain continuity of essential services
- Prepare the legal foundation for a democratically elected constitutional assembly

The authority of any transitional body must be limited, time-bound, and transparent.

Its mandate is not to rule.  
Its mandate is to prevent chaos and enable lawful renewal.

Once a legitimate constitutional government is formed through free public election, all transitional structures must automatically dissolve.
