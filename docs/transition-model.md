# Transition Model

## 1. Purpose of the Transition

A political transition is not an act of revenge.  
It is a process of stabilization.

The purpose of this transition model is to prevent cycles of violence, avoid institutional collapse, and ensure that power is transferred through lawful and transparent mechanisms toward a democratically elected constitutional order.

Moments of regime delegitimization are historically fragile.  
If unmanaged, they can lead to:

- Revenge-based violence
- Arbitrary purges
- Power vacuums
- Emergence of a new authoritarian structure

The central objective of this framework is therefore restraint.

Justice must replace anger.  
Procedure must replace impulse.  
Institutions must replace personalities.

This transition model proposes a temporary, civilian-based structure designed to:

- Safeguard public order without repression
- Ensure due process in accountability proceedings
- Prevent mob retaliation or extrajudicial punishment
- Maintain continuity of essential services
- Prepare the legal foundation for a democratically elected constitutional assembly

The authority of any transitional body must be limited, time-bound, and transparent.

Its mandate is not to rule.  
Its mandate is to prevent chaos and enable lawful renewal.

Once a legitimate constitutional government is formed through free public election, all transitional structures must automatically dissolve.

## 2. Core Risks of an Unmanaged Transition

Political transitions triggered by a loss of legitimacy are inherently unstable.  
Without a structured framework, three systemic risks typically emerge:

### 2.1 Revenge-Based Violence

Public anger, especially after periods of repression or bloodshed, can escalate into collective retaliation.

Uncontrolled retaliation leads to:
- Extrajudicial punishment
- Property seizures without due process
- Personal vendettas disguised as justice
- Escalation into cycles of violence

Such dynamics weaken moral legitimacy and create conditions for future authoritarian restoration.

Justice must be institutional, not emotional.

### 2.2 Institutional Collapse

When state authority weakens abruptly, critical systems may fail:

- Public security
- Judicial continuity
- Financial administration
- Infrastructure coordination

A sudden vacuum of authority creates fragmentation and opportunistic power centers.

Institutional continuity — even during restructuring — is essential to prevent chaos.

### 2.3 Power Vacuum Exploitation

History shows that unstructured transitions often produce:

- Competing armed factions
- Revolutionary tribunals without oversight
- Charismatic figures claiming emergency authority
- Concentration of power justified as temporary necessity

Temporary emergency power has a documented tendency to become permanent.

A transition must therefore design its own limitations from the beginning.

### 2.4 Emotional Capture of Justice

When victims or directly affected groups assume judicial authority without structural safeguards, the line between justice and revenge can blur.

This does not diminish the legitimacy of suffering.  
It recognizes the need for procedural distance in order to preserve fairness and long-term stability.

Conflict-of-interest safeguards are essential for credible accountability.

The purpose of identifying these risks is not to suppress public demand for justice.

It is to ensure that justice strengthens the future —  
rather than destabilizes it.
