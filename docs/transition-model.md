# Transition Model

## 1. Purpose of the Transition

A political transition is not an act of revenge.  
It is a process of stabilization.

The purpose of this transition model is to prevent cycles of violence, avoid institutional collapse, and ensure that power is transferred through lawful and transparent mechanisms toward a democratically elected constitutional order.

Moments of regime delegitimization are historically fragile.  
If unmanaged, they can lead to:

- Revenge-based violence
- Arbitrary purges
- Power vacuums
- Emergence of a new authoritarian structure

The central objective of this framework is therefore restraint.

Justice must replace anger.  
Procedure must replace impulse.  
Institutions must replace personalities.

This transition model proposes a temporary, civilian-based structure designed to:

- Safeguard public order without repression
- Ensure due process in accountability proceedings
- Prevent mob retaliation or extrajudicial punishment
- Maintain continuity of essential services
- Prepare the legal foundation for a democratically elected constitutional assembly

The authority of any transitional body must be limited, time-bound, and transparent.

Its mandate is not to rule.  
Its mandate is to prevent chaos and enable lawful renewal.

Once a legitimate constitutional government is formed through free public election, all transitional structures must automatically dissolve.

## 2. Core Risks of an Unmanaged Transition

Political transitions triggered by a loss of legitimacy are inherently unstable.  
Without a structured framework, three systemic risks typically emerge:

### 2.1 Revenge-Based Violence

Public anger, especially after periods of repression or bloodshed, can escalate into collective retaliation.

Uncontrolled retaliation leads to:
- Extrajudicial punishment
- Property seizures without due process
- Personal vendettas disguised as justice
- Escalation into cycles of violence

Such dynamics weaken moral legitimacy and create conditions for future authoritarian restoration.

Justice must be institutional, not emotional.

---

### 2.2 Institutional Collapse

When state authority weakens abruptly, critical systems may fail:

- Public security
- Judicial continuity
- Financial administration
- Infrastructure coordination

A sudden vacuum of authority creates fragmentation and opportunistic power centers.

Institutional continuity — even during restructuring — is essential to prevent chaos.

---

### 2.3 Power Vacuum Exploitation

History shows that unstructured transitions often produce:

- Competing armed factions
- Revolutionary tribunals without oversight
- Charismatic figures claiming emergency authority
- Concentration of power justified as temporary necessity

Temporary emergency power has a documented tendency to become permanent.

A transition must therefore design its own limitations from the beginning.

---

### 2.4 Emotional Capture of Justice

When victims or directly affected groups assume judicial authority without structural safeguards, the line between justice and revenge can blur.

This does not diminish the legitimacy of suffering.  
It recognizes the need for procedural distance in order to preserve fairness and long-term stability.

Conflict-of-interest safeguards are essential for credible accountability.

---

The purpose of identifying these risks is not to suppress public demand for justice.

It is to ensure that justice strengthens the future —  
rather than destabilizes it.


## 3. Transitional Civic Council

### 3.1 Nature and Purpose

The Transitional Civic Council is a temporary, civilian-based body established to safeguard stability during a period of political transition.

It is not a permanent government.  
It is not a revolutionary authority.  
It is not a substitute for an elected parliament.

Its sole mandate is to prevent systemic collapse, ensure lawful accountability, and prepare the conditions for democratic constitutional formation.

---

### 3.2 Foundational Principles

The Council must operate under the following constraints:

- **Temporariness** — Its authority is strictly time-bound.
- **Transparency** — All decisions must be publicly documented.
- **Limited Scope** — It cannot legislate beyond transitional necessity.
- **Non-Partisanship** — Members may not represent political factions.
- **Civilian Supremacy** — All security restructuring remains accountable to civilian oversight.
- **Conflict-of-Interest Safeguards** — Individuals directly involved in prior political violence may not serve in adjudicative roles.

---

### 3.3 Core Functions

The Council’s responsibilities are limited to:

1. Supervising transitional justice mechanisms grounded in due process.
2. Overseeing temporary restructuring of national security under unified civilian accountability.
3. Protecting public order without suppressing lawful civic expression.
4. Preserving continuity of essential state services.
5. Preparing procedural groundwork for the election of a constitutional assembly.

The Council may not:
- Extend its own mandate.
- Suspend fundamental human protections.
- Establish parallel armed forces.
- Override the outcome of a free public election.

---

### 3.4 Selection and Legitimacy

Legitimacy must derive from broad civic endorsement and transparent criteria.

Membership criteria should include:

- Demonstrated public trust
- Absence of involvement in prior systemic repression
- No active affiliation with armed factions
- Commitment to procedural neutrality

Selection mechanisms must be publicly auditable.

---

### 3.5 Sunset Clause

The Council automatically dissolves upon:

- The formal establishment of a democratically elected constitutional assembly, or
- The ratification of a new constitutional order.

No transitional authority may continue beyond this point.


## 4. Transitional Justice Framework

### 4.1 Purpose

The purpose of transitional justice is not retaliation.

It is to establish accountability through lawful, structured, and transparent procedures in order to prevent future cycles of violence.

Justice must restore institutional credibility —  
not satisfy collective anger.

---

### 4.2 Guiding Principles

All transitional accountability mechanisms must adhere to:

- **Due Process** — No individual may be detained, prosecuted, or sanctioned without formal legal procedure.
- **Presumption of Innocence** — Collective guilt is prohibited.
- **Individual Responsibility** — Accountability applies to actions, not affiliations.
- **Proportionality** — Penalties must be legally defined and proportionate.
- **Public Transparency** — Proceedings must be documented and accessible.
- **Right to Defense** — Every accused individual must have legal representation.

---

### 4.3 Institutional Safeguards

To prevent politicization or revenge dynamics:

- Individuals directly affected by prior violence may not serve in adjudicative roles.
- Emergency tribunals without procedural safeguards are prohibited.
- All prosecutorial and judicial functions must be separated institutionally.
- Independent oversight mechanisms must monitor proceedings.

The legitimacy of the transition depends on visible procedural fairness.

---

### 4.4 Scope of Jurisdiction

Transitional justice mechanisms are limited to:

- Allegations of severe violations of human rights
- Systemic corruption tied to abuse of public authority
- Crimes involving unlawful lethal force or torture

The framework must clearly define its jurisdiction to prevent arbitrary expansion.

---

### 4.5 Asset Recovery and Public Transparency

Where credible evidence demonstrates unlawful appropriation of public assets:

- Investigations must follow documented evidentiary standards.
- Asset recovery must be judicially authorized.
- Recovered assets must be publicly audited and transparently allocated.

Asset accountability must reinforce public trust — not create new opaque power structures.

---

### 4.6 Non-Retroactive Expansion of Power

Transitional justice bodies may not:

- Create new categories of crime retroactively.
- Expand their jurisdiction beyond defined mandate.
- Extend their own authority indefinitely.

All mechanisms must operate under predefined temporal limits.

---

### 4.7 Completion and Dissolution

Transitional justice structures automatically dissolve once:


## 5. Security Reorganization During Transition

### 5.1 Purpose

The objective of security restructuring during transition is to prevent fragmentation, retaliatory violence, and the emergence of parallel armed power centers.

Public safety must be preserved without reproducing repression.

Security reform during transition is not a purge.
It is a stabilization process under civilian authority.

---

### 5.2 Civilian Supremacy

All armed and security structures must operate under transparent civilian oversight.

No security institution may exercise autonomous political authority.

Civilian accountability is a non-negotiable condition of legitimacy.

---

### 5.3 Unified National Structure

A transition must move toward a unified national security framework.

Parallel armed institutions undermine stability and create long-term risks of internal power competition.

The transitional authority may supervise:

- Structural consolidation under a single national framework
- Clear chains of accountability
- Temporary operational continuity to prevent collapse of public order

---

### 5.4 Continuity with Screening Safeguards

Institutional continuity is necessary to prevent chaos.

However, individuals credibly implicated in severe violations of human rights must be subject to lawful review under the transitional justice framework.

Screening mechanisms must be:

- Evidence-based
- Individually assessed
- Legally reviewable

Collective dismissal without due process is prohibited.

---

### 5.5 Protection of Civic Expression

Security forces during transition must prioritize:

- Protection of peaceful assembly
- Protection of political pluralism
- Protection of minority groups

The function of security is protection — not ideological enforcement.

---

### 5.6 Prohibition of Expansion

During transition:

- No new armed factions may be created.
- No emergency militias may be legalized.
- No temporary security structure may outlive the transitional mandate.

All emergency measures must contain explicit expiration conditions.

---

### 5.7 Long-Term Constitutional Direction

The transition may recommend that the permanent constitutional order:

- Recognize only one national military structure
- Prohibit parallel armed institutions
- Establish clear limits on military authority
- Restrict the development of offensive or mass-destruction capabilities in accordance with international norms

Final determination of permanent security doctrine belongs to the constitutional assembly.

- Their defined mandate is fulfilled, and
- A permanent constitutional judiciary is established.

Justice during transition must bridge toward stability — not institutionalize emergency authority.
