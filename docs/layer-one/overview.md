# Layer One — Constitutional Foundation  
## Proposed Structural Framework for the Transitional Authority

---

## 1. Constitutional Architecture

The constitutional order of the future Republic shall consist of four hierarchical layers:

### Layer One — Constitutional Foundation  
Non-amendable structural principles defining the limits of power and the inviolable foundations of legitimacy.

### Layer Two — National Legislative Order  
Laws enacted by the National People's Assembly.  
All legislation must comply with Layer One.

### Layer Three — Local Governance Frameworks  
Constitutional and administrative systems adopted by regional or state governments.  
All local structures must comply with Layers One and Two.

### Layer Four — Civil and Economic Agreements  
Contracts and legally binding agreements between natural or legal persons.  
All agreements must comply with Layers One, Two, and Three.

---

## 2. Hierarchical Supremacy

Each constitutional layer derives its legitimacy from compliance with the layers above it.

- No provision of Layer Two may contradict Layer One.
- No provision of Layer Three may contradict Layers One or Two.
- No contract or agreement in Layer Four may contradict Layers One, Two, or Three.

In case of conflict, the higher layer shall prevail.

---

## 3. Permanence of Layer One

Layer One shall be finalized and ratified by the Transitional Authority and transferred intact to the Constituent Assembly.

Layer One shall not be amended, suspended, reinterpreted, or overridden by any legislative, executive, military, judicial, or local authority.

Its function is structural limitation of power and permanent prevention of dictatorship in any form.

## 4. The Four Foundational Pillars of Layer One

Layer One rests upon four permanent pillars:

### I. Human Dignity  
The inherent and equal dignity of every person is the sole source of political legitimacy.  
No authority may enact or enforce laws that violate fundamental freedoms, equality before the law, or peaceful civic participation.

### II. Legitimate Use of Force  
The use of armed force shall be unified under a single national military structure.  
No parallel, ideological, partisan, or private armed forces shall be permitted.  
Any order violating Human Dignity is inherently invalid.

### III. National Ownership of Natural Resources  
All natural and strategic resources belong collectively to the people.  
Their management shall be transparent and nationally administered.  
No authority may transfer sovereign ownership of such resources.  
Individual public benefit shares shall not be confiscated or involuntarily invested.

### IV. Fair and Voluntary Civic Order  
Legal and economic agreements are valid only when formed through informed, voluntary, and equitable consent.  
Agreements formed under coercion, structural imbalance, or absence of meaningful choice are subject to judicial review and invalidation.

## 5. Principle of Legal Meaning

The legitimacy of law derives not only from its text, but from its documented purpose and meaning.

Every enacted law must be accompanied by a clear public explanation of its intent, rationale, and constitutional alignment.  
The purpose and spirit of the law shall be publicly accessible and preserved as part of its legal record.

Citizens shall be encouraged not toward blind obedience, but toward understanding the spirit and reasoning of the law.

In judicial review, courts shall consider:

- Whether the spirit of the law was violated;
- Whether an individual acted in good faith to uphold the law’s purpose;
- Whether deviation from the letter of the law occurred under exceptional conditions while preserving its intent.

Demonstrated understanding of the spirit of the law and good-faith alignment with its purpose shall be considered a significant factor in mitigation, pardon, or proportional judgment.

## 6. Purpose

Layer One does not govern daily political operations.  
It defines the structural boundaries within which all governance must operate.

Its authority is foundational.  
Its scope is permanent.  
Its purpose is the prevention of concentrated, irreversible, or unaccountable power.
