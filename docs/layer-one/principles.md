# Layer One — Foundational Principles

This document defines the four permanent principles that constitute Layer One of the constitutional architecture.

Layer One establishes the non-amendable structural limits of power and the foundational legitimacy of the constitutional order.  
All legal, institutional, and contractual systems within the Republic derive their authority from compliance with these principles.

Detailed interpretations and operational definitions are provided in the referenced documents for each principle.

## I. Human Dignity

Human dignity is the sole and ultimate source of political legitimacy.

All persons are equal before the law and possess inherent rights that no authority may suspend or override.  
No law, institution, or public action may violate fundamental freedoms, equality, or the right to peaceful civic participation.

This principle governs the relationship between the individual and all forms of authority.

See: `./human-dignity/index.md`

## II. Legitimate Use of Force

The authority to use organized force shall exist only within a unified national structure operating under constitutional limits.

No parallel, ideological, partisan, or private armed forces shall be permitted.  
Any command or action that violates Human Dignity or constitutional legitimacy is inherently invalid.

This principle governs the lawful boundaries of military and security power.

See: `./force/index.md`

## III. National Ownership of Natural Resources

All natural and strategic resources belong collectively to the people.

Their management must be transparent, nationally administered, and exercised solely for public benefit.  
No authority may transfer sovereign ownership of such resources or confiscate the people's share of national benefit.

This principle governs the relationship between the nation’s wealth and public authority.

See: `./resources/index.md`

## IV. Fair and Voluntary Civic Order

Legal, civic, and economic agreements are valid only when based on informed, voluntary, and equitable consent.

Structures or agreements formed under coercion, structural imbalance, or absence of meaningful choice may be reviewed and invalidated by the judiciary.

This principle governs legitimacy in social, legal, and economic interactions.

See: `./civic-order/index.md`

## Authority of the Principles

These four principles are permanent and non-amendable.

No legislation, regional governance framework, institutional rule, or private agreement may contradict them.  
In any conflict of interpretation, compliance with these principles shall prevail over all lower legal provisions.

They define not policies, but the boundaries within which all policy must operate.
